            When the «rate» stereotype is applied to an activity edge, it
            specifies the expected value of the number of objects and
            values that traverse the edge per time interval, that is, the
            expected value rate at which they leave the source node and
            arrive at the target node. It does not refer to the rate at
            which a value changes over time. When the stereotype is
            applied to a parameter, the parameter must be streaming, and
            the stereotype gives the number of objects or values that
            flow in or out of the parameter per time interval while the
            behavior or operation is executing. Streaming is a
            characteristic of UML behavior parameters that supports the
            input and output of items while a behavior is executing,
            rather than only when the behavior starts and stops. The
            flow may be continuous or discrete. The «rate» stereotype
            has a rate property of type InstanceSpecification. The
            values of this property must be instances of classifiers
            stereotyped by «valueType» or «distributionDefinition».
            In particular, the denominator for units used in the rate
            property must be time units.

    bound of 1 to ensure that stale data is overridden at an input pin.
    For upper bounds greater than one, the token replaced is the one
