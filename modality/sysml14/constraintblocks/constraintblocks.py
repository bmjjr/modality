    """
    A constraint block is a block that packages the statement of a
    constraint so it may be applied in a reusable way to constrain
    properties of other blocks. A constraint block typically
    defines one or more constraint parameters, which are bound to
    properties of other blocks in a surrounding context where the
    constraint is used. Binding connectors, as defined in Chapter
    8: Blocks, are used to bind each parameter of the constraint
    block to a property in the surrounding context. All properties
    of a constraint block are constraint parameters, with the
    exception of constraint properties that hold internally nested
    usages of other constraint blocks.
